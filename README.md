## Libraries Used

### Next.js
- **Why:** Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. It provides a great developer experience with features like file-based routing, API routes, and automatic code splitting, which enhances performance.

### React
- **Why:** React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components, making the development process more efficient and maintainable.

### TypeScript
- **Why:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. It helps catch errors during development, improves code quality, and enhances the overall developer experience with better tooling and autocompletion.

### Formik
- **Why:** Formik is a library for building forms in React. It simplifies form handling, validation, and submission, making it easier to manage form state and validation logic.

### Yup
- **Why:** Yup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. It works well with Formik to provide a robust validation mechanism for form inputs, ensuring that user inputs meet specified criteria.

### Tailwind CSS
- **Why:** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development. It provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be composed to create custom designs without leaving the HTML, promoting a consistent design system.

### ESLint
- **Why:** ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code. It helps maintain code quality and consistency across the project by enforcing coding standards.

### PostCSS
- **Why:** PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. It allows for the use of modern CSS features and optimizations, enhancing the styling capabilities of the application.
